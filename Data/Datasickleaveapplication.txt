Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave for [number of days] days from [start date] to [end date] as I am currently unwell and unable to attend work.

Due to [briefly mention your illness or health issue, e.g. fever, flu, doctor's appointment, etc.], I am not in a condition to perform my duties effectively and need to take some time off to recover. I am undergoing treatment and expect to be back to work soon.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will ensure that all my tasks are completed as soon as possible. I will keep you updated on my health and will be available by email if anything urgent comes up during my absence.

I have attached a medical certificate from my doctor for your reference. If there is any additional information required, please let me know.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
